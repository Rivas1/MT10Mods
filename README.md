# MT10Mods

The Yamaha FZ-10/MT-10 and MT-10 SP is a bloody good bike. 

There are however certain areas of the bike that can be improved either by a bit of manual labour or simply replacing parts from other bikes.

This repo will try to highlight what the community has done to their bikes.

## Chassis

### Suspension adjustment for Road

Suspension settings for road set up for a member at the MT-10 SP group.

### Rear suspension (SP)
The author of this repo contacted Öhlins regarding the spring rate on the MT-10 SP.
> Hello Öhlins,
>I'm trying to figure out the spring rate for the Yamaha MT-10 SP and if I 
>should adjust it with a new spring. I'm around 95kg with all my gear on. 
 
> __Öhlins responded:__

> Standard spring is article number 21040-29, rate 90N/mm, should be ok for your weight depending on your riding style.
>
> If you want to use harder spring you can go to article number 21040-34, rate 100N/mm.


## Brakes

### Front brake master cylinder upgrades

#### R1 upgrade
It is possible to replace the master cylinder and lever from an R1/R1M 2015.

The standard MT-10 needs a new mirror fitting because the mirror is fitted to the reservoir itself.

The MT-10 SP has a different reservoir with no mirror attachment, as the attachment is fitted to the bracket.

Notice difference in part 11 below.

You will need a way to fit a brake fluid reservoir. Some use Brembo kits, some use different methods.

#### Brembo RCS 19 upgrade
This fine piece of kit fits the bike brilliantly. However there needs to be done work for the brake switch/cruise control.

### Front brake calipers

MT-10 owners can upgrade to R1/R1M calipers directly.

MT-10 SP owners would look at Brembos. But it looks like Brembos would need spacers/different brake discs.

At least one member on Facebook has fitted Brembo GP4 RS calipers.


## Electronic

### 12v outlet
The standard outlet is quite shoddy on keeping adapters in place because of the horizontal placement.

Author of repo fitted an elastic band around the assembly by loosening a screw.

Other bike owners have fitted dedicated USB outputs, some even show voltage.

## Wheels

## Luggage

### Givi/kappa full setup

Givi offers a full range of products that fits the MT-10.

Author already has a tanklock bag with the MT-10 tanklock ring (BF27).

Side cases are available with a quick release system (PLXR2129) and V35 side cases.

A cheaper option, but nearly identical is the the Kappa KLXR2129 and K33N side cases.
